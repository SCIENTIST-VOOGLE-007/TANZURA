# TANZURA 🌊 Microplastic Detection Platform

> Safeguarding water, pixel by pixel.

## 💡 Overview

TANZURA is a FastAPI-powered web app that uses deep learning to detect microplastics in water. Built on U-Net architecture, it provides actionable health safety insights by classifying water into risk levels: Safe, Moderate, or High.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔬 U-Net model for semantic segmentation of microplastic particles.
- 🚦 Risk Classification System:
  - **Safe**: Minimal contamination
  - **Moderate**: Use with caution
  - **High**: Unsafe for consumption
- 🌐 FastAPI for efficient backend performance.
- 🧪 OpenCV-based preprocessing of microscopic water sample images.
- 🗂️ MongoDB for storing and retrieving historical test data.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Model**: U-Net (Keras/PyTorch)
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Database**: MongoDB

## 📦 Installation
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TANZURA.git
